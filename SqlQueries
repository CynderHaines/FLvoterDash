select count(*) from miami

Error: 0xC020844B at Data Flow Task, ADO NET Destination [2]: An exception has occurred during data insertion, the message returned from the provider is: Received an invalid column length from the bcp client for colid 38.
imported flat data file with text stream data type for column 38 which produced varchar(MAX) data type for column 38. imported into that table in order to fix error. would also be resolved by changing existing table column 38 data type to varchar(MAX) but may require SQL Server setting to allow saving changes that will recreate the table. may also be possible with alter table command using vaarchar(MAX) as datatype
